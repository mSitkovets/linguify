# Why did I make this?
I wanted to make a website where people could practice their vocabulary in another language. My idea was for users to be able to create their own quizzes and practice quizzes that others made. They also have their own profile page that keeps track of their progress for each quiz that they've taken. If they are an Admin then they have the ability to delete quizzes made by any user and also edit the statistics of each quiz. 

# What did I learn?
I learned how to design and create my own database in MySQL. I also built the entire backend as well as some parts of the frontend using Ruby on Rails. I also tried building most of the frontend in React, which I was completely new to.
